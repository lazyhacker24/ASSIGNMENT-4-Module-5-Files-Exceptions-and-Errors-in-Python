Overview

This assignment focuses on Python file handling, including reading, writing, appending data, and handling errors gracefully. It contains two tasks:

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

Problem Statement:

Open and read a text file named sample.txt.

Print its content line by line.

Handle errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Python File: task1.py

Sample Content of sample.txt:

This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines.


Expected Output:

If the file exists:

Reading file content:

Line 2: It contains multiple lines.


If the file does not exist:

Error: This file 'sample.txt' was not found.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

Problem Statement:

Take user input and write it to a file named output.txt.

Append additional data to the same file.

Read and display the final content of the file.

Python File:task2.py

Sample Run:

Enter text to write to the file: Hello, Python!
Data successfully written to output.txt.

Enter additional text to append: Learning file handling in Python.
Data successfully appended.

Final content of output.txt:
Hello, Python!
Learning file handling in Python.


Note:

The output.txt file is automatically created by the program if it does not exist.
